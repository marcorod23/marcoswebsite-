  <h3 class="w3-center">Memoir</h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em>What Made Me, ME</em></p>
  <p> 
I believe we are all on a life-mission trying to find ourselves. I’ve been trying to find myself for a while now. Many people go their whole lives without figuring out who they are, and I think it’s sad that most of those people are not presented with the opportunities to find themselves. When I was in elementary school, I came to the conclusion that if I wanted to do something, no matter what it was, I had to do it to the best of my ability. I think if you're investing your time into anything you shouldn’t waste your time it by not putting your best effort into it, you know? Anyways, I know it is cliché and even cringe to talk about this on a memoir and that we all go through things in our lives, but I truly believe the shift of mindset I had while growing up set the tone for the way I view things now. Without that “shift” I wouldn’t be where I am today, physically and mentally. Look, trust me I know everyone has their own hardships and challenges but it’s the way I approach and react to them that makes it different from my perspective. 
Shifting gears, let’s take it back to where this whole “change” started. I freshly remember when I was in sixth grade, I was so depressed because I had just moved to this place that was completely different from where I was at before. I had no friends and family here as I did at home but most importantly I didn’t know how to interact with these new people, hell I couldn't even speak the same language as them. People take their own languages for granted, in my opinion, people should expand their brains and try to learn several languages, who am I to talk though, I only learned this new language because I had to or else I wouldn’t have been able to succeed. Instead of giving up and letting this language barrier slow me down, I sped up my learning process and put in the extra time and effort to keep moving forward in society and life in general. As long as I can remember I’ve always loved challenges. My dad once told me to “avoid unchallenging occupations because “they waste your talents.” and for me learning a new language has certainly been a never-ending challenge because up to this day I, like everyone else, still learn new words and things every day. The social and academic hurdle I faced throughout the earlier years of my life is one of the many reasons for what drove me to succeed academically. 
My perseverance didn’t just come from trying to learn a new language and dealing with everything that came with that. On top of that, I had to constantly isolate myself from my own siblings because they were not the best influences around. At a young age, a teen just wants to spend time with their friends and family. However, as I was growing up, I soon realized my friends and even siblings weren't the right people to be around. My friends turned towards drug usage, gang involvement, and rebellious personalities. My brothers who are supposed to be role models soon joined my friends and I was stuck on the other side. The more I hung around them, the more I became like them. most of my grades started dropping and that’s when I realized I had to distance myself from bad influences. Soon my brothers’ decisions started catching up to our family since my brothers were constantly getting in trouble with the law, considering we basically lived in poverty, paying all those fines kept stressing our family financially. I grew up watching my friends and brothers throw their lives away for many years. It was difficult going home to a place where you basically couldn’t fit in, it was difficult seeing a way out, I thought I was just going to become another statistic. 
My parents always went to bed early due to working late hours every day and I always came home late from school, it was tough not “seeing” them you know, I didn’t like it at all, but I knew my parents were sacrificing themselves for me and ultimately my siblings as well. It’s a daunting task, having to not only deal with social and financial issues but with family issues as well. As I look back on my life journey (obviously really short considering I’m barely eighteen), I can truly say I am grateful to experience all the struggles and achievements that come with making a new path in a new country. I started to understand what hard work and dedication meant because of my parents' sacrifices. My family moved to this country seeking a greater opportunity to better the lives of their children, with the heart aching reality of leaving our loved ones behind. With moving to a new country, came a struggling battle. From sharing a two-room apartment with another family to finally call a place home, our drive to succeed was limitless.  
I’m passionate about my mindset, I’m passionate about staying positive even when everything is going wrong, I’m passionate about trying to succeed, I’m passionate about being the best version of myself that I can be, but most importantly I’m passionate about being who I am. I want to improve the version of myself from the previous day, even if it's in the simplest way possible. In my opinion, anything can be achieved with a dedicated attitude and effort, because those are things you can truly control. You can’t control what life throws at you, all you can control in life is how you respond to life. 
At this same time with all these things happening around me, there was still a problem, an internal battle I had going on. Something I thought I couldn’t help when I was little,  that’s right I was really overweight and I couldn't do physical activities, I mean I could do them but I gave up easily because I wasn't fit for them. I was constantly bullied for being fat, and yes I know there are so many stories about this but in all honesty, all that bullying just added to many things that led me to turn my lifestyle around. I started exercising and even eating better, which was really difficult since I was so accustomed to eating junk food in my free time. I remember running the mile in my physical education class and not being able to run it without having to stop and walk, but over time I started believing in myself I started to see improvement. I dedicated so much time to trying to become the fastest kid, almost as if I had something to prove to everyone, which I didn't because no one cared . Still, I was so motivated to become the fastest kid that I would run and train as if I was in a track team. By the end of the year, I was so in shape that I was finally the top runner in my grade. This continued later on all the way through middle school high school, I basically started doing sports the year after this happened and as stupid as this sounds, I realized that anyone could become “great” at something if they put enough time and practice into whatever it was that they were trying to improve. This mindset I like to talk about has changed my life completely, and it wasn't because someone came up to me and told me that I needed to get my head right, no not at all. In fact, I did it all by myself, I chose to change my life around, and I think that’s what makes my mindset “unique”, that’s what I like to call it. Intrinsic motivation goes a long way, in comparison to extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation comes from within someone's deeper wish, as opposed to extrinsic where you have to be rewarded to be motivated. 
I didn't choose to be born into poverty and a life full of barriers and challenges. I was given what I was given, I just had to work around it and make the best of it by trying to be positive all the time. This so-called transformation of outlook and perspective on life is what made me step out of my comfort zone many times, it is why I now have the goal to leave this earth with as many achieved dreams as I can carry out. Think about it, there are so many people who have left this earth without acting on their dreams because they were afraid. They were afraid to take on a challenge, they were afraid to step out of their comfort zone. Those same people could have been the next to discover the cure to many unknown diseases, the next to change the world, the next to make a difference in people's lives, they could have been the next to be great things we’ve yet to be great at. But that doesn't happen, simply because people are afraid to take on challenges. I want to be able yo say that I changed the world. Changing one person’s life can be considered as changing the world because they are part of this world and by you changing their lives, they're going to change someone's life and then they'll change somebody else’s life and so on. If we all make an effort to change someone's life for the better, this world can become phenomenal. I only talk about a few examples and as small as these events may seem, they definitely changed my life. I think this turning point in my life is what made me find myself a little more than before. However, I still think that I haven't found myself completely because I'm a teenager. I don't think it’s normal to have found who you're going to be for the rest of your life when you’re barely eighteen years old, but it certainly did contribute in shaping me into who I am today.

      <p> Shifting gears, welcome to My Website. My name is Marco Rodriguez and this website was established just so I have an excuse to learn web development at an easy level and talk a few points about myself so you all can get to know me a little bit. Anyways you will see a lot about me becasue duh it's my website. Lets begin, I was born on July 23, 2001, in San Bernardino, California. I moved to Mexico City at the age of 3 and was raised for most of my childhood until the age of 9. I then moved back to the United States and have been here since 2010. I went to Golden Oak Elementry, Richland Junior High, and Shafter 
          High School for my k-12 education. In high school I played three sports 
          for two years, Football, Soccer, Track and Field, which then narrowed down to only Football and Track and Field due to time issues. I was involved in many extra curricular activities and community services. In January 24, 2019 I was awarded the Young Person Award of 2019 for the City of Shafter California. Over the past 5 years I've had several jobs such as an agriculture worker, a landscaping worker, a remodeling worker,
          a McDonald's crew member, and a water technician at a water district. My senior year of highschool, I was accepted into UC Berkeley, UC Los Angeles, UC Davis, UC Santa Barbara, and many other schools, yet I chose to go to Cal Poly. I am currently an udergraduate student at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo seeking my Bachelors and Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering. </p>

  <h3 class="w3-center">Change Your Life By Bringing Powerbeats Pro Into Your Life</h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em> 
Technology is developing day by day and we can see the advancement of it too. If you are one of those people that values music and is motivated by it, then these headphones are for you! The, totally wireless high-performance earphones with adjustable, secure-fit ear hooks for lightweight comfort and stability, Apple Beats Powerbeats Pro are some of the best gadgets you can use to enjoy music and change your lifestyle.

Designed to keep up with your toughest workouts, with a reinforced design for sweat and water resistance and adjustable, secure-fit ear hooks for added comfort and stability, this gadget is perfect for athletes. With up to nine hours of use per charge, the new technology integrated into these new beats leaves less room to worry about charging your headphones and more room to worry about moving forward with your life. The Powerbeats also comes with a charging case that enables more than 24 hours of listening time, as well as a fast fuel charge of five minutes that gives you about 1.5 hours of playback. Integrated with on-ear controls that allow you to control the volume, tracks, and calls on both earbuds, this new gadget destroys the competition on the market. Coming in at a height of 2.2 inches and a weight of 0.71 ounces, the Powerbeats Pro gadget is perfectly portable.

In addition to all these tech features, the Powerbeats Pro comes in four different colors such as Black, Ivory, Moss, and Navy, to assure you receive the design that suits you best. Life today is filled with anxiety and stress as everyone gets busy with their life. Music adds pleasure to this distasteful life. In fact, life without music would be boring, dull and stressful. Music has been used in relieving daily stress by giving life energy and attraction. First, consider the many ways in which music benefits humans; Music provides motivation, a key component for accomplishing any task such as exercise, studying, and even the music of an alarm clock, initiating the start of another day. Creativity and self-expression are two more avenues where music contributes positively to human nature. Music has the power to inspire, alleviate, and console every human emotion as well as providing a successful career for performing artists. The list of positive influences music generates in the world are endless and must not be taken for granted. For this main reason, the Powerbeats Pro brings you the best features available on the market. This is when the noise-cancellation features of the Beats by Dre come into play. Most high-quality on-ear headphones have the noise cancellation feature to eliminate all the unwanted background noise and the Powerbeats Pro by Dre offers this in two forms: passive noise-cancellation which is unaided electronically and active noise cancellation which is aided by a device that drowns out the noises. Most competitive headphone brands emphasize one feature over another such as the noise-cancellation ability or just the sound quality on their headphones but the Beats by Dre includes both key features that complement every aspect of the music to suit the different preferences of the listeners. You do not want to be the only one without a pair of the newest wireless headphones out there. Successful people need their music to thrive, to help them get through barriers in tough times. Athletes need their music to get in their zone to perform as best as they can, teens need their music to get through moody days. Everyone needs their music. These new Powerbeats Pro will help you achieve just that. Gather some money and get you some Powerbeats Pro to help ensure your success in life, they won’t disappoint you.

  <h3 class="w3-center">“Small Town, Big Dreams”</h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em> 
 
Living in a small town can limit the perspective of one’s mind, leaving one to believe that hardly anything exists beyond the borders of one’s town.  In a small-infamous-farm town lying in the central valley, there are countless individuals who are seeking to pursue and find their dreams, identities, and passions. A lack of cultural experience and awareness seems to permeate the town of Shafter, leaving the kids of this small town with little knowledge of what the world truly has to offer, which discourages them of their full potential. However, a man from Shafter California has proven that it is possible to find your purpose in life in such circumstances. I’ve personally had the pleasure of getting to know this selfless individual seeking to better the lives of the people around him and inspire them with his accomplishments, letting them know that the phrase “small town big dreams” is achievable. 
Jordan Lewis grew up in Shafter, California and graduated top of his class from Shafter High School (Home of the Generals!). After flourishing in high school he went on to attend Fresno Pacific University on an athletic and academic scholarship. He decided Fresno Pacific was not where he wanted to achieve his goals, so he dropped out and went to a community college in Bakersfield until he figured out what path he really wanted to take while continuing to pursue his passion of running track and field. Lewis is the perfect example of someone who is fearless, he is not afraid of failing, and only preaches to people that “it is okay to fail because you will learn and bounce back even better after experiencing failure.” Jordan is willing to put himself out there and will travel several roads to reach his goal because no matter what happens, he will make sure he achieves what he is pursuing. 
At a young age, many teenagers are afraid of failure due to it potentially being there for the world to see it. Lewis was different and didn’t care if people knew he would fail, he would do his best day in and day out, regardless of the circumstances. Thriving at Bakersfield College and finishing his career there, he then proceeded to attend Baylor University on an athletic scholarship and ran as a 400-meter hurdler. While attending Baylor University in Texas he had numerous barriers he had to deal with while trying to succeed as a hurdler and student. His first year at Baylor, Lewis faced very poor coaching and was on the verge of getting cut from the team since he wasn’t scoring points for the team. Athletes have to train to be successful; it takes a lot of work to attain athletic success and to stay at that championship level. “Diet, exercise, practice, day in and day out, repeating things over and over again, watching film, researching your opponents, analyzing and planning workouts. There is so much work involved day-to-day, and it gets stressful.” With that being said he had to take training into his own hands in order to flourish as a runner and be able to attain his dream of becoming a professional hurdler. Lewis expressed how he “took the key to the training facility and made a copy of it to do extra workouts before and after practice and on weekends.”  Since the coaches weren’t making him any better with the training they presented him Jordan had to train and work relentlessly on his own to become better. Jordan went from almost getting cut by the team, to winning the 400-meter-hurdles Big 12 Championship Conference at the Division 1 collegiate level. Though he did reach this great accomplishment, he still came short of his main athletic goal when he wasn't able to qualify for the Olympic trials. Although he experienced a setback, years later as an assistant coach at Baylor, Lewis received the opportunity to coach runners who did qualify for the trials, as well as other astonishing athletes, such as Robert Griffin III, who is now an NFL Quarterback. Lewis said “failing at reaching one of my biggest dreams just led me to assist others in achieving theirs.”  as he expressed how there is always a reason for everything that happens in life. Despite having to work, being a collegiate athlete, and helping financially back at home, Jordan Lewis graduated with Bachelor’s and Master's Degrees in Mathematics where he then decided he wanted to come home and inspire others as he stated “I had goals to achieve in other places but I always wanted to come home.”
Shafter, the “Potato Capital of the World,” is known by the motto ”where everything grows.” He explains how, ”not only do crops grow here in Shafter but also the people that work and are raised in this community,” people are able to grow here through their everyday lives facing adversity and overcoming it. In that same community “where everything grows”  there is also a lot of examples where people do the opposite of growing; they give up, they lose hope, they stop believing. He knows that kids have dreams and aspirations but lose that because of the bad influences and environment surrounding them which is why Lewis wants to make a difference and make sure that people don’t stop pursuing their “crazy” dreams.
By Lewis living in the “Potato Capital of the World”, he spent a copious amount of his youth working in the potato shed with his family which developed his insane work ethic. He would work at the potato shed with his father during his free time, ran every day for two to three hours, did homework at night, and went to school in the mornings.  He explained how he would have to work various days where the weather was well over one-hundred degrees and when he was done with that there was no break for him, he went straight to practice to improve his skills on the track. Jordan would often say “you just gotta practice” which he still preaches to his runners and students. He one-hundred percent believes that anything can be done with practice and dedication, which is what gives this man a sense of credibility. His life experiences drive him to bring values and build them into his students: especially his athletes. When students, runners, and people, in general, listen to him: they do it with an intent to get something out of what he is going to say, they genuinely look up to him. Lewis finds immense passion in what he does which greatly affects those under him. He strives to lead young students and athletes to reach their full potential and spends a lot of his time studying things to be able to help them out in any way. Since coaching can be extremely time consuming, he finds it harder to inspire and lead others now that he is also trying to do this with his own two children and wife at home. “A big reason I keep doing it, is because I know how much a coach can make a difference.” He is very well known and respected in Shafter, as he is one of the biggest role models for young adults and kids. In fact, Lewis is featured in the “Have Dreams: People Who Inspire Us” campaign/project in Shafter where people are able to see his accomplishments and know more about him. 
Lewis’ strong faith in God, has strengthened his passion to help others see that God is the only answer to people’s problems. This happens to also be one of his biggest passion in life; it is what got him through all the tough times and is what he stands by so stoutly. “My faith hasn’t always been strong and that is when things only got worse. Once I realized that God was the only thing that would solve my problems was when things began taking off. God is the one and only answer to your problems.” With his own faith he just leads by example, Lewis does not do this by pushing it on to his students or athletes at all, he lets them find their own faith through their experiences. Many of the great athletes that he has coached were ones that were very close to him and had a strong faith in their religion. Lewis does all of these things as he relates it back to his faith in God. “as a Christian there are no off days.” There are only slumps in both of these aspects. “The answer to pulling yourself out of this is through God” and as a mentor, Lewis helps athletes who are trying to find that faith achieves just that. 
Lewis didn't know he was a fan of a small community until he experienced the “big city life”. He became a teacher to be able to fulfill one of his goals, which was to inspire kids, but it wasn't always great. Before Lewis came back to his community as a teacher and coach, he taught in a community that was the complete opposite of the one where he grew up in. “The students in this wealthy area are worse than the ones I deal with here. They were very spoiled and got away with everything as long as Mom and Dad gave a check.” Lewis explained how he relates to kids more in Shafter, which enables him to become more of a mentor to them. “It made me appreciate the students here, they are way better behaved and are genuinely good kids.” He finds it not easier but more enjoyable to teach in his hometown, where he can relate to many of his students and help guide them. Lewis continues to do his best to keep up the spirits of teens and kids, and he can always be found either in the classroom or at the track, doing what he does best: inspiring others.

  <p class="w3-center"><em> 
What made me into the person I am today? I have asked myself this question many times before, yet it all leads back to the same concept. In fact, I came to the conclusion that it is simply a summarization of our developing years. For example, some of our biggest influences, especially in those early years, are our parents, friends, coaches, etc. All these factors build your character and persona that can determine whether you’ll be successful or not. Your determination to have success is decided by your drive, whether you want to succeed in life or be mediocre. 
People need to know their purpose, why they’re here. One cannot achieve success until they have a mindset on what they want to achieve. It’s almost impossible for people to attain true happiness in what they do until they truly love the goals and achievements they’ve reached. Success comes with the ability to fully understand what goals you want to strive for. Featured in the New York Times, author Terri Maxwell of Succeed On Purpose: Everything Happens For A Reason wrote in her book “people need clarity of purpose to succeed.” (Maxwell) People who are constantly striving to achieve something meaningful in life crave clarity. It’s the only way to reach deeper into yourself to find out what makes you come alive. once you define your purpose, you will become unstoppable. Once you find your “why”, you will be more careful and selective about your daily actions. In the words of  Frederick Nietzsche, a German philosopher, cultural critic, composer, poet, philologist, and Latin and Greek scholar whose work has exerted a profound influence on modern intellectual history, “He who has a why can endure anyhow.” (Anderson 2017) Successful people have a definite sense of direction. They have a clear understanding of what success means to them. Everything they do is consistent with their goals. They look forward and decide where they want to be. Their day to day actions help them move closer to their vision. 
Success and hard work go hand in hand simply because life is designed to be difficult. Nothing is given to anyone, it's only attained through hard work and dedication. Overall the people who work hard overcome anything that’s thrown their way, whether it’s research to go through, working late, or maybe even kissing up to the boss to get on his good side. Many tend to give up if they fail on one or more occasions and never attempt to participate again. People who have an intelligent method of working hard towards success tend to enjoy the process of constant hardship. Napoleon Hill once said, “There is one quality that one must possess to win, and that is definiteness of purpose, the knowledge of what one wants, and a burning desire to possess it.” (Napoleon) Everything needed to live an authentic and meaningful life is already within you. It’s simply a matter of uncovering it. Don’t let fear stand in the way of getting real with yourself. By giving in to fear, you deprive yourself of the opportunity to step into true power and achieve happiness. 
Some may say it’s valid that your current life is, to a large extent, the result of your past actions, choices, and experiences. However, your life can be determined by how you act in the present moment. In other words, your past does not have to define you or your future. All of us have made our share of mistakes,  most of us have also experienced bad situations that were not necessarily our fault. Some of us have experienced circumstances so bad that they could be considered traumatic. I know that I have made many mistakes and bad choices in my own life in the past. I have hurt people who did not deserve to get hurt, wasted precious time, told lies, neglected my health, taken my parents for granted, and been selfish and self-centered. These feelings of regret, guilt, resentment, and anger used to weigh me down and affect my outlook on life. I felt like I was living in the past even though I knew that I could not change what transpired. I wanted to progress and move forward, but I was futilely trying to get ahead while constantly looking into the rearview mirror. But then something changed. I realized that my past only had a grip on the present because I allowed it. I decided to accept the fact that I could not change the past and embrace the notion that I had complete autonomy to make wise choices in the present moment. Another thing I did was to forgive myself for my past mistakes and also forgive those who had caused me to hurt. No matter what has happened in your past, you can choose how much power over your current life you want it to afford it. You cannot change the past, but you can choose how you react to it.
Despite the severity or magnitude of your past mistakes, you can choose to look at them differently. Instead of viewing them with constant regret, try to see them as valuable lessons that you can use today. “If you have neglected your health, become overweight, gotten divorced, lied, hurt others, wasted time or a large sum of money, etc, you can come to the realization that you are wiser now for your experiences.” (Oppong 2017 )You are not the person that you once used to be and therefore, do not have to make the same mistakes that you once made. The decisions we’ve made are the advantage that gives us the edge to complete our goals. You do not have to continuously punish yourself for past wrongdoings, become the best version of yourself because it will empower you to give back to others and the world at large.
Overall, everyone’s virtues are different depending on the environment they are raised in. Growing up, our environment, friends, family or any role model can all influence our virtues which then translate into who we are up to date. Obviously, we all have different stories and experiences about our childhood with many characters that influence us, both positively or negatively, and because of that, we all grow to be significantly different with different values. Today, we are still growing as people and our virtues help us continue to pursue our success. Everyone needs to realize and know what made them who they are today.
