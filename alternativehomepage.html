  <h3 class="w3-center">Memoir</h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em>What Made Me, ME</em></p>
  <p> 
I believe we are all on a life-mission trying to find ourselves. I’ve been trying to find myself for a while now. Many people go their whole lives without figuring out who they are, and I think it’s sad that most of those people are not presented with the opportunities to find themselves. When I was in elementary school, I came to the conclusion that if I wanted to do something, no matter what it was, I had to do it to the best of my ability. I think if you're investing your time into anything you shouldn’t waste your time it by not putting your best effort into it, you know? Anyways, I know it is cliché and even cringe to talk about this on a memoir and that we all go through things in our lives, but I truly believe the shift of mindset I had while growing up set the tone for the way I view things now. Without that “shift” I wouldn’t be where I am today, physically and mentally. Look, trust me I know everyone has their own hardships and challenges but it’s the way I approach and react to them that makes it different from my perspective. 
Shifting gears, let’s take it back to where this whole “change” started. I freshly remember when I was in sixth grade, I was so depressed because I had just moved to this place that was completely different from where I was at before. I had no friends and family here as I did at home but most importantly I didn’t know how to interact with these new people, hell I couldn't even speak the same language as them. People take their own languages for granted, in my opinion, people should expand their brains and try to learn several languages, who am I to talk though, I only learned this new language because I had to or else I wouldn’t have been able to succeed. Instead of giving up and letting this language barrier slow me down, I sped up my learning process and put in the extra time and effort to keep moving forward in society and life in general. As long as I can remember I’ve always loved challenges. My dad once told me to “avoid unchallenging occupations because “they waste your talents.” and for me learning a new language has certainly been a never-ending challenge because up to this day I, like everyone else, still learn new words and things every day. The social and academic hurdle I faced throughout the earlier years of my life is one of the many reasons for what drove me to succeed academically. 
My perseverance didn’t just come from trying to learn a new language and dealing with everything that came with that. On top of that, I had to constantly isolate myself from my own siblings because they were not the best influences around. At a young age, a teen just wants to spend time with their friends and family. However, as I was growing up, I soon realized my friends and even siblings weren't the right people to be around. My friends turned towards drug usage, gang involvement, and rebellious personalities. My brothers who are supposed to be role models soon joined my friends and I was stuck on the other side. The more I hung around them, the more I became like them. most of my grades started dropping and that’s when I realized I had to distance myself from bad influences. Soon my brothers’ decisions started catching up to our family since my brothers were constantly getting in trouble with the law, considering we basically lived in poverty, paying all those fines kept stressing our family financially. I grew up watching my friends and brothers throw their lives away for many years. It was difficult going home to a place where you basically couldn’t fit in, it was difficult seeing a way out, I thought I was just going to become another statistic. 
My parents always went to bed early due to working late hours every day and I always came home late from school, it was tough not “seeing” them you know, I didn’t like it at all, but I knew my parents were sacrificing themselves for me and ultimately my siblings as well. It’s a daunting task, having to not only deal with social and financial issues but with family issues as well. As I look back on my life journey (obviously really short considering I’m barely eighteen), I can truly say I am grateful to experience all the struggles and achievements that come with making a new path in a new country. I started to understand what hard work and dedication meant because of my parents' sacrifices. My family moved to this country seeking a greater opportunity to better the lives of their children, with the heart aching reality of leaving our loved ones behind. With moving to a new country, came a struggling battle. From sharing a two-room apartment with another family to finally call a place home, our drive to succeed was limitless.  
I’m passionate about my mindset, I’m passionate about staying positive even when everything is going wrong, I’m passionate about trying to succeed, I’m passionate about being the best version of myself that I can be, but most importantly I’m passionate about being who I am. I want to improve the version of myself from the previous day, even if it's in the simplest way possible. In my opinion, anything can be achieved with a dedicated attitude and effort, because those are things you can truly control. You can’t control what life throws at you, all you can control in life is how you respond to life. 
At this same time with all these things happening around me, there was still a problem, an internal battle I had going on. Something I thought I couldn’t help when I was little,  that’s right I was really overweight and I couldn't do physical activities, I mean I could do them but I gave up easily because I wasn't fit for them. I was constantly bullied for being fat, and yes I know there are so many stories about this but in all honesty, all that bullying just added to many things that led me to turn my lifestyle around. I started exercising and even eating better, which was really difficult since I was so accustomed to eating junk food in my free time. I remember running the mile in my physical education class and not being able to run it without having to stop and walk, but over time I started believing in myself I started to see improvement. I dedicated so much time to trying to become the fastest kid, almost as if I had something to prove to everyone, which I didn't because no one cared lol. Still, I was so motivated to become the fastest kid that I would run and train as if I was in a track team. By the end of the year, I was so in shape that I was finally the top runner in my grade. This continued later on all the way through middle school high school, I basically started doing sports the year after this happened and as stupid as this sounds, I realized that anyone could become “great” at something if they put enough time and practice into whatever it was that they were trying to improve. This mindset I like to talk about has changed my life completely, and it wasn't because someone came up to me and told me that I needed to get my head right, no not at all. In fact, I did it all by myself, I chose to change my life around, and I think that’s what makes my mindset “unique”, that’s what I like to call it. Intrinsic motivation goes a long way, in comparison to extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation comes from within someone's deeper wish, as opposed to extrinsic where you have to be rewarded to be motivated. 
I didn't choose to be born into poverty and a life full of barriers and challenges. I was given what I was given, I just had to work around it and make the best of it by trying to be positive all the time. This so-called transformation of outlook and perspective on life is what made me step out of my comfort zone many times, it is why I now have the goal to leave this earth with as many achieved dreams as I can carry out. Think about it, there are so many people who have left this earth without acting on their dreams because they were afraid. They were afraid to take on a challenge, they were afraid to step out of their comfort zone. Those same people could have been the next to discover the cure to many unknown diseases, the next to change the world, the next to make a difference in people's lives, they could have been the next to be great things we’ve yet to be great at. But that doesn't happen, simply because people are afraid to take on challenges. I want to be able yo say that I changed the world. Changing one person’s life can be considered as changing the world because they are part of this world and by you changing their lives, they're going to change someone's life and then they'll change somebody else’s life and so on. If we all make an effort to change someone's life for the better, this world can become phenomenal. I only talk about a few examples and as small as these events may seem, they definitely changed my life. I think this turning point in my life is what made me find myself a little more than before. However, I still think that I haven't found myself completely because I'm a teenager. I don't think it’s normal to have found who you're going to be for the rest of your life when you’re barely eighteen years old, but it certainly did contribute in shaping me into who I am today.

      <p> Shifting gears, welcome to My Website. My name is Marco Rodriguez and this website was established just so I have an excuse to learn web development at an easy level and talk a few points about myself so you all can get to know me a little bit. Anyways you will see a lot about me becasue duh it's my website. Lets begin, I was born on July 23, 2001, in San Bernardino, California. I moved to Mexico City at the age of 3 and was raised for most of my childhood until the age of 9. I then moved back to the United States and have been here since 2010. I went to Golden Oak Elementry, Richland Junior High, and Shafter 
          High School for my k-12 education. In high school I played three sports 
          for two years, Football, Soccer, Track and Field, which then narrowed down to only Football and Track and Field due to time issues. I was involved in many extra curricular activities and community services. In January 24, 2019 I was awarded the Young Person Award of 2019 for the City of Shafter California. Over the past 5 years I've had several jobs such as an agriculture worker, a landscaping worker, a remodeling worker,
          a McDonald's crew member, and a water technician at a water district. My senior year of highschool, I was accepted into UC Berkeley, UC Los Angeles, UC Davis, UC Santa Barbara, and many other schools, yet I chose to go to Cal Poly. I am currently an udergraduate student at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo seeking my Bachelors and Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering. </p>
